subroutine definitions:

  subroutine_1(input side):
    Take the top corner of the input side and fold it into the center crease to form a 90 degree triangle

  subroutine_2(input side):
    Take the edge of the inputside you just made at the corners and also fold and align into the center crease

  subroutine_3(input side):
    On the input side of the folded paper, take the top edge and fold it down to align with bottom edge and crease

main procedure:
  step 1: 
    Place standard 8.5x11 piece of paper with long side facing you on table

  step 2:
    Fold paper in “hot dog style”(join the two longer edges, then crease the fold) and reopen the paper

  step 3: 
    subroutine_1(left side)

  step 4:
    subroutine_1(right side)

  step 5:
    subroutine_2(left side)

  step 6:
    subroutine_2(right side)

  step 7:
    Now fold the entire paper along the first crease made in step 2

  step 8:
    subroutine_3(left side)

  step 9:
    subroutine_3(right side)
