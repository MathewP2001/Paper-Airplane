Place standard 8.5x11 piece of paper with long side facing you on table


Fold paper in “hot dog style”(join the two longer edges, then crease the fold) and reopen the paper


Take one of the top corners and fold it into the center crease to form a 90 degree triangle


Do the same with the other top corner which should form a tip at the top of your paper


Take either one of the edges you just made at the corners and also fold and align into the center crease


Do the same with the corner edge which form a pointier triangle at the top of your paper


Now fold the entire paper along the first crease made in step 2


On both either side of the folded paper, take the top edge and fold it down to align with bottom edge and crease


Repeat for the opposite side
